This project details the development of a machine learning pipeline to analyze drivers of non-fire related forest loss in the Acadian region (Northern Maine study area, 2001-2021). Following a project re-scoping for solo completion in mid-April 2025, the work built upon prior group explorations into spectral tree species classification using Sentinel-2 imagery and GBIF occurrence data. These initial attempts encountered significant challenges including species data sparsity, high spectral similarity among target species, and critical technical failures in spectral signature extraction (e.g., a key script iteration reported 100% of âˆ¼7,700 GBIF points as outside image boundaries), leading to low preliminary model performance (e.g., ~29% RF accuracy for species ID).
This necessitated a strategic pivot to a more robust analysis of aggregate annual forest loss events derived from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset, predicted using a Random Forest classifier. Predictor features include time-lagged Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 annual composites (spectral bands and vegetation indices like NDVI/NBR), annual TerraClimate data (mean temperature, total precipitation), and static SRTM topographic data (elevation, slope), all processed and aligned to a 30m grid.
Key methodological steps documented include: data acquisition via Google Earth Engine; pre-processing, notably the local merging of GEE-tiled Landsat exports using gdal_merge.py and rigorous data alignment verification; various pixel sampling approaches, including aggressive downsampling for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) run to manage extensive NaN values encountered in feature data and for rapid pipeline testing; feature engineering with mean imputation for NaNs; and a temporal train/test split for evaluation.
Initial MVP results, focusing on target years 2001-2002 with approximately 100,000 downsampled points, demonstrated pipeline functionality but yielded modest predictive performance (ROC AUC 0.56), primarily attributed to the limited temporal scope of the MVP, aggressive downsampling, and persistent NaN issues in some predictor variables even after imputation. The project emphasizes the iterative nature of data-driven research, the critical impact of data quality and processing challenges, and the successful establishment of a complete analysis pipeline poised for further refinement and full-scale execution. Git history was rewritten prior to final submission to manage large data files, with original author dates preserved.
