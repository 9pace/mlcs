Prelim Draft Abstract: 
This project applies deep learning to analyze tree species distribution changes in response to climate change. We plan on developing: (1) a CNN to identify forest cover and density changes over time from historical and current datasets in order to establish distribution trends; and (2) a predictive model that identifies potential correlations between environmental conditions and observed distribution shifts. Using high-resolution satellite imagery and datasets with labeled distribution changes over time, we can explore patterns of tree species movement. Understanding these distribution changes is crucial for monitoring ecological shifts and predicting landscape transformations. Results may provide further insights for developing effective conservation strategies, guide reforestation initiatives through identification of optimal planting sites, and contribute to biodiversity protection as ecosystems respond to climate change.
